        question: "What is the Virtual Dom ?",
        answer: "A virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the Document Object Model used in declarative web frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Elm. Updating the virtual DOM is comparatively faster than updating the actual DOM."

        question: "What is a Linked List ?",
        answer: "Like an array, a linked list refers to a linear data structure in which the elements are not necessarily stored in a contiguous manner."

        question: "What is a Stack ?",
        answer: "A stack refers to a linear data structure performing operations in a LIFO (Last In First Out) order. In a stack, elements can only be accessed, starting from the topmost to the bottom element."

        question: "What are the concepts introduced in OOPs ?",
        answer: "Following are the concepts introduced in OOPs: 1) Object - A real-world entity having a particular state and behavior. We can define it as an instance of a class. 2) Class - A logical entity that defines the blueprint from which an object can be created or instantiated. 3) Inheritance - A concept that refers to an object gaining all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It provides code reusability. 4) Polymorphism - A concept that allows a task to be performed in different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.  5) Abstraction - A concept that hides the internal details of an application and only shows the functionality. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.    6) Encapsulation - A concept that refers to the wrapping of code and data together into a single unit."
