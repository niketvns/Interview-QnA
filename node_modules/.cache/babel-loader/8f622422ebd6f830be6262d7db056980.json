We can define it as an instance of a class. 2) Class - A logical entity that defines the blueprint from which an object can be created or instantiated. 3) Inheritance - A concept that refers to an object gaining all the properties and behaviors of a parent object. It provides code reusability. 4) Polymorphism - A concept that allows a task to be performed in different ways. In Java, we use method overloading and method overriding to achieve polymorphism.  5) Abstraction - A concept that hides the internal details of an application and only shows the functionality. In Java, we use abstract class and interface to achieve abstraction.    6) Encapsulation - A concept that refers to the wrapping of code and data together into a single unit.\"}];","map":{"version":3,"names":["questions","id","question","answer"],"sources":["D:/Documents/Web Technology/react_app/accordian_react/src/Api.js"],"sourcesContent":["export const questions = [\r\n    {\r\n        id: 1,\r\n        question: \"What is the Virtual Dom ?\",\r\n        answer: \"A virtual DOM is a lightweight JavaScript representation of the Document Object Model used in declarative web frameworks such as React, Vue.js, and Elm.
